# Calendar

I'm creating a calendar connected to a database to get used to hosting a php project on heroku.

View project [Link](https://daily-todo-calendar.herokuapp.com/user_profile/login.php)

### Bugs

- When creating an event, if the input has "'" the data won't save to the database.
- If a date isn't saved in the session the yearly and monthly calendar won't be displayed.

### Left to implement

- Need to give the user the ability to repeat an event yearly or it be a one time occasion.
- Add a carousel for the monthly calendar view.
