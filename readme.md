# Calendar

I'm creating a calendar connected to a database to get used to hosting a php project on heroku.

View project [Link](https://daily-todo-calendar.herokuapp.com/user_profile/login.php)

## UX

The layout of this project is broken up into a few sections, First the user will need to make and accont to use the application. After, the user will be able to create their own calendar to keep track of their life chores/goals or anything they wish. I'll be adding a functionality where users can add friends to share/compete with each other to see who can do the most. Graphs will be shown to give the users all the inforamtion they will need to improve their goals, different categories of calendars will be able to be tracked also. This will allow the user to progress/track in all area's of their life.

### Bugs


### Left to implement

- Need to give the user the ability to repeat an event yearly or it be a one time occasion.
- Add a carousel for the monthly calendar view.
- Need to add a variable on the users account to confirm if you have already completed the tutorial.
